      <h5>The bottom part of reptile skulls are not connected like mammal skulls. They are instead attached by a ligament, meaning it can stretch much easier. Did you know that some snakes eating their food is equivalent in proportion to their head as a human eating a whole watermelon?</h5>
              </li>
                  <li>
                  <h5>Often, when you encounter a snake, the snake is more scared of you than you are of it. Because of this both you and the snake are trying to find quickest escape route, which may be the same path. The only exception to this is the Bushmaster.</h5>
                </li>
                <li>
              <h5>Rattlesnakes are venomous. Check out the link at the top of the page for more information.</h5>

                  <li>
                  <h5>Baby rattlesnakes can control their venom well. If anything baby rattlesnakes are less dangerous due to their lower venom yeilds. That being said, do not interect with rattlesnakes unless you are accompanied by an expert.</h5>
                </li>
                  <li>
                  <h5>While rattlesnake do gain a section of their rattle each shed. These rattles sometimes break off, often making you guess the rattlesnake's age as lower that it actually is.</h5>

      <h3>Where did these myths originate?</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Snakes can open their mouth much more and than mammals. When someone does not understand how this is very different from mammals may assume snakes dislocate their jaw when eating.</li>
        <li>When a snake is trying to run away from you, it is easy to misunderstand this and assume it is chasing you. Also this is propelled by an overall fear of snakes.</li>
        <li>Many people thing rattlesnakes are poisonous instead of venomous. This is propelled by misinformation by friends, family. peers, and popular movies and entertainment.</li>
        <li>I could not find a definient origin for this myth, but is is spread by a general lack of education in reptiles and misunderstanding and fear of venomous snakes.</li>
        <li>This is somewhat true to an effect since rattlesnakes gain a rattle at every shed, people just often forge tthat these rattles fall of the snake very easily.</li>
        <li>This propably originated from stories of people who were chased by crocodiles.</li>
        <li>This is just caused by a fear of snakes.</li>
