      <h4>Garden nets</h4>
      <p>Garden nets are often used to prevent deer and birds from eating people's gardens.</p>
      <p>Reptiles can get tangled up in this where they cannot escape and can even die because of this if not helped.</p>
      <p>If you see a reptile tangled in a garden net, if it is nonvenomous, please help it out if you can safely. Beware that the snake may have been there for a while, because of this the snake may be more aggressive because it is lacking food and is scared. Beware of this.</p>
      <p>Some alternatives to garden nets are getting plants that are already deer and bird resistant. You can put up a scarecrow or fake predator to birds. You can also put up more strudy fencing that reptiles can not move it and get themselves tangled up in it.</p>

      <h4>Pesticides</h4>
      <p>Pesticides are meant to get rid of pests like invertabrates on your crops or yard.</p>
      <p>This poisons the invertabrates. Animals that eat these will be poisoned as well, and even more so since they eat many of these poisoned bugs. This moves up the food chain through biomagnification. This poisons the entire food chain and leads to animals which you were not even targeting to be poisoned. In addition the pesticide can go to the water through runoff and affect your local water negatively ecosystem in the same way. </p>
      <p>Biopesticides are different than chemical pesticides and can be batter for the environment.Gravitate towards plants that are naturally resistant to pests. You can make your own natural pesticides with pepper spray. (research this further to learn more)</p>

      <h4>Mouse Traps</h4>
      <p>These traps are supposed to trap rats.</p>
      <p>These traps can frequently trap animals that are not rats if they want the cheese in the trap. Also this is painful to animals that are trapped inside of these, escepailly if they are not killed by this and wait to starve to death.</p>
      <p>You could create a mouse trap where the mice follow cheese into a hole in which they fall down into and cannot come back up. They can run over a bicket lid that turns similair to some trash cans that trap the mouse by falling into it.</p>

      <h4>Glue Traps</h4>
      <p>These traps are supposed to trap rats.</p>
      <p>These traps can frequently trap animals that are not rats. Also this is painful to animals that are trapped inside of these, they are trapped in uncomfortable places and try very hard to escape. They painfully starve to death.</p>
      <p> If you find a snake in a glue mouse trap, if you can safely do this, use oil to get the snake out.</p>
