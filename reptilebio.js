They are omnivores that eat mostly fruit and bugs. They grow to around 10-24 inches long. Crested geckos are named for the crests they have on the top of their head and over their eyes. Crested geckos are arboreal, and commonly kept in captivity as a beginner pet. They are nocturnal. Because they are nocturnal, they have vertical slit pupils. (they also have clear coverings for their eyes, so they do not have eyelids, because of this they lick their eyes often to keep them moist and do not close their eyes when sleeping.", "The Argentine Black and White Tegu is native to Argentina, and invasive in Florida. they thrive in subtropical environments. These are cousins to the monitor. Tegus sheds their skin in one complete shed about twice a year. The Argentine Black and White Tegus are omnivores and eat various foods in the wild, including insects, fruits, vegetables, small mammals, and birds. Tegus can weigh up to 25 pounds and grow to 2.5 - 4 ft long.", "Chinese Alligators are one of the 2 only living alligator species. Their range is restricted to a small part of China. They live in freshwater and by rivers in China. Chinese alligators are carnivorous and feed on many different types of creatures, these include fish, crustaceans, snails, rodents, birds, and insects. They grow 5 - 7 feet long and up to 85 pounds as adults. The Chinese Alligator's only threat to population are humans, humans kill them and destroy their habitat. It is now illegal to harm a Chinese Alligator in China and a reserve was built for them in China.", "Eastern Indigo Snakes are native to the USA and they are the longest native colubrid in that country. They can reach 5 - 7 feet in length and 1.6 - 9.9 pounds. They do not reach maturity until 3 - 5 years after birth. They are endangered because this means it is more difficult to reproduce. They require a lot of range ( the remaining places of their range they have left need to be bigger for them and are still being minimized by humans.)", "Fiji Banded Iguanas were previously thought to be the same species as the Lau Banded Iguanas but this was proved false in 2008. They live in the Fiji Islands of australia and prefer to live in the wet coastal plant filled parts of these islands. They eat a diet of mostly plants but sometimes feed on insects. Their lifespan averages 10 to 15 years. They reach sexual maturity at about 3-4 years. Females lay clutches of 5 eggs in a hole in the ground they dig, they incubate for 7 to 9 months.", "The common musk turtle, also commonly called a stinkpot turtle because they have a tendency to musk or expel a foul odor when scared or threatened. They are very small for a turtle. Surprisingly these turtles live from 40 to 60 years of age. They are native to north america and live in freshwater environments. They are eaten by many native species such as snakes, large fish, snapping turtles, or even amphibians. They are omnivorous with mostly meat but occasionally eating plant matter.", "Water Moccasins or Cottonmouths are named after the white inside of their mouth that they often show they they are threatened. These snakes live in the water and are venomous. They are native to north america and grow to 2-4 ft in length. These snakes are solitary and prefer not to live in groups. Unfortunately, many people kill these snakes out of fear since they are venomous, but they help the local environment greatly so I strongly encourage you not to do this. People also sometimes kill harmless water snakes after mistaking them from cottonmouths. Look down this page for identifying details for the cottonmouth. Many different animals can eat juvenile cottonmouths; the main predators of adults are alligators and some hogs."];

This species has a similar impact on it's environment as other gecko species in its area (such as Leachianus geckos and Gargoyle geckos ). The main threat to crested gecko is not it's predators, but humans. Humans threaten Crested geckos mostly through deforestation and habitat loss.", "In their native habitat, Argentine Black and White Tegus are an apex predator, they help to control the populations of other species. They also can eat carrion (which has already been killed) and this helps to clean up their local environment. In addition, burrows created by tegus are used by different types of species in their area. In some areas of their native habitat, they are considered a pest because they eat farmers’ chickens. In other areas ( such as Florida), however, tegus are invasive and cause major destruction to the local environment ( in the (Everglades ). They eat native species and spread disease. (To take action against this, Argentine Black and White Tegus are illegal to keep as a pet in Florida for fear that they are released into the local environment.)", "Chinese Alligators are the apex predator in their range in China. They help their local environment by keeping the populations of fish, crustaceans, snails, birds, and small rodents in check. They now have a sanctuary in their range so that they can be preserved since the main threat to the population of Chinese Alligators is humans. In conclusion, Chinese alligators keep the populations of their prey in check and their local freshwater wetland environment.", "Eastern Indigo Snakes are carnivorous and eat many snakes (other species of snake are their main diet), rodents, birds, frogs,  and other small mammals in their local environment. They are near the top of their food chain but are predated only by humans through illegal hunting, pesticides, and habitat loss.", "Fiji Banded Iguanas are mainly herbivores but on occasion feed on small insects. Their predators are local cats and the asian mongoose. They sometimes can often cause damage to human infrastructure as well as leave droppings on it. They are endangered mainly because of humans causing sever habitat loss in their only native habitat (The Fiji Islands).", "The common musk turtles typically likes in freshwater environments and spend most of their time in water. They eat mostly small animals such as fish or insects and sometimes eat plant matter. They are predated on by snapping turtles, snakes, or even large fish.", "Cottonmouths keep the population numbers of their prey in check. This includes birds, small mammals or rodents, some amphibians, fish, some lizards, small turtles, and even baby alligators. They have many differing predators as juveniles, but as they grow older they are mainly a food source for hogs and alligators."];
array5 = ["A Crested Gecko’s natural habitat is a forest, because of this they are arboreal (tree-dwelling). This means that they require a vertically oriented cage with a high humidity ( this can be achieved through frequent misting or a reptile humidifier). Crested geckos should have moist soil to encourage humidity, but if the soil is always damp, your gecko can develop scale rot of their stomachs from always sitting on wet soil. Adult Crested Geckos need a minimum 10 - 20 gallon enclosure. Crested geckos can be fed food supplements for new caledonian geckos (I personally feed pangea) as well as supplementing with live or dead bugs. Crested geckos do not require UVB or nail trims, they do require some kind of basking spot, and some kind of day - night cycle. Crested geckos are easy to handle exceot that they have a tendency to jump when agitated or bored. You can quickly learn to read the signals of when your gecko wants to jump, and handle your crested gecko pretty easily.", "Argentine Black and White Tegus are pretty high maintenance compared to other reptiles. They require UVB and a basking spot. They need high humidity and tropical substrate. They are omnivores and eat a variety of foods. Baby tegus require more protein than older tegus but they need a healthy balance of both fruits and vegetables in their diet. ( There is a whole branch of reptilinks specifically tegus so if you don’t feel like spending too much time shopping you can feed reptilinks, but still do your research. ) They need a large hide and temperature gradient in their enclosure. The enclosure should be at least 4ft by 8ft for an adult, horizontally orientated ( 4ft high ). The Argentine Black and White tegu is easily handled, it is more like a gentle giant. There is even a harness you can get to take them on walks.", "Not in Captivity (Except for conservation purposes)", "These are not kept in captivity by the average keeper, and are only kept for zoos or conservation efforts. (or both)", "These iguanas require humid environments and a tropical substrate to mimic their natural environment. Their backing spot should reach to about 95 degrees fahrenheit and 75 degrees fahrenheit at night. Their diet consists of mainly plants but can occasionally be fed insects. Their tank should have high ventilation and be a minimum of 4 ft by 2 ft by 3 ft with the largest side being the width.", "Juveniles should have 20-29 gallon tank while adults should be kept in at least a 29 gallon tank. The substrate is not necessary but if you prefer to have some, you can use large gravel. The temperature of the water should be kept from 72 degrees fahrenheit to 76 degrees fahrenheit. Hatchlings should be kept from 78 degrees fahrenheit to 80 degrees fahrenheit. The water depth should be around 10in for the shallow end and 2ft for the deep and. Hatchlings should have 3-4 inches of water depth. Common musk turtles require UVB bulbs and and varied diet of mostly meat although they occasionally can eat some plants.", "Unless you are keeping this reptile for educational purposes, I advise not to keep this in captivity since it is a venomous snake."];
array6 = ["Crested geckos have the ability to climb things like glass because of their unique foot structure. Instead of using sticky substances or suction cup like parts, crested geckos have millions of tiny hairs on their toe pads. These thin and tiny hairs are called setae. The setae have a weak attraction to the wall by them selves, but using so many of the gecko's feet, they are able to temporarily stick to the wall.","Tegus can drop and regrow their tails. Tails can be dropped for predators or due to tail injuries or stress. When a tegu regenerates their tail, their tail does not look the same as the original after regenerating.","Chinese Alligators are the only species of alligator that have tough and solid scales around their entire body to protect them.
