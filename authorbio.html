       <h5> I am very passionate about reptiles. Many people are uneducated about reptile dangers, behavior, and benefits. Reptiles have a bad stigma that I hope to reduce. I am working on a Girl Scout Gold Award focusing on reptile education. Not many people care about reptiles and there is a lack of education in the community about reptiles. They also have a negative reputation. In addition, there is a lot of false information in movies and many myths people repeat and learn.I will address this root cause by education. I will teach and encourage people to learn more about reptiles through social media, posters, brochures, a website, and participating and meeting people in festivals and word of mouth. </h5>

        <h5>My name is Emily, I am in 10th grade and I have a passion for herpetology, especailly reptiles. Some of my hobbies are arts and crafts, puzzles, learning, herpetology and making this project.

         <h5>I plan to measure my impact in many ways to prove I am helping people learn about reptiles, and to determine wich things I should improve upon and which things I should focus on. I plan to measure in multiple in ways. One of these ways is forms. After talking to someone in person at a festival or event, I can ask them to fill out a form on what they learned from me, and what they would do with this new acquired information. In addition I will add questions at the bottom of the page of my website that measures how many people were correct or learned from the website. Also I will use website analytics to show how many people read the information in the pages. Also, locally, I will measure how many people take one of my brochures (which will contain useful information about reptiles). I will later put this information in pie charts and graphs to help track how well I am doing and what I should improve upon or focus on more.</h5>

        <p>This is Nacho. He is my crested gecko. He is around 3 years around (As of the year 2024). He is currently the only reptile I have and I enjoy keeping him. He is fun to handle (though once he peed on my schoolwork).  </p>
