        <h4>So much so that I am making a wall of classification in my room, The wall demonstrates how all of these
          reptile families are related to another. Here I will explain them and expand on some of the genuses and
          species. I will also make digital art of some species, and will probably include AI art in many places.</h4>

          <h2>Squamata</h2>
          <h3>Snakes and Lizards</h3>
          <p>Snakes and lizards are so closely related that they are both classified into the same order, Squamata. Squamata consists of scaled reptiles including the 6 suborders of Gekkota, Scincoidia, Lacertoidia, Anquimorphia, Serpentes, and Iguania. These include snakes, lizards, and legless lizards. To clear up a common misconception, legless lizards are not snakes, some identifying characteristics of snakes vs legless lizards are:Snakes have belly scutes that look different from the rest of their body.Snakes do not have eyelids.Snakes have shorter tails.(The tail starts at the cloaka, then to the end of the animal).etcetera.With that out of the way, squamata is the largest reptile order in terms of species, with over 10900 species. It is also the newest order out of the 4.

          <h2>Testudines</h2>
          <h3>Turtles and Tortoises</h3>
          <p>Testudine reptiles encased in a body shell, and plastron. This includes turtles and tortoises. It contains 14 families of turtles. Some easy and main ways to tell tortoises from other turtles ( all tortoises are turtles but not all turtles are tortoises ) is that tortoises tend to live on land, and have more domed shells. Tortoises also tend to live longer ( the longest living turtle is the galapogos tortoise )They tend to be larger.(Even though the largest turtle is the loggerhead turtle) This is as opposed to turtles who have more flat aerodynamic shell to live underwater. Turtles also tend to be smaller.</p>

          <h2>Crocodalia</h2>
          <h3>Crocodiles, Alligators, Caimans and Gharials</h3>
          <p>The crocodalians include Alligators, caimans, crocodiles, and gharials. Crocodalia splits aligator and crocodiles into different groups in crocodalia. The way to tell the difference between alligators and crocodiles is very simple. The main way I personally use is that the snout of crocodiles are more trianglular than alligators, and slligator snouts are wider. (Gharial's snouts look like striaght lines, and are very easy to tell about from that) ANother way to tell is that crocodiles often have more teeth showing from the side of their mouth than alligators. In addition caimains are often smaller than alligatora crocodiles and gharials.</p>

          <h2>Rhynchocephalia</h2>
          <h3>Tuataras</h3>
          <p>Rhynchocephalia included only one extant species. The Tuatara (Sphenodon punctatus) are native to New Zealand. They have internal ears and unique scalation that separate them from lizards, among other traits. </p>
