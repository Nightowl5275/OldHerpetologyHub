    <h3>Under this section is a list of reptiles from Africa that I (other very helpful volunteers) have made for this website. Each list item has a scientific name and a page number (as well as what continents this reptile is native to.) To use the page number, you go to the Reptile Bio Page of this website (see link directly to left) and enter the same page number into the prompt. This will take you to the bio of the animal you want. (Please be aware that if you reload the site you will have another prompt and you will have to type the same page number to access the same reptile bio.) Thank You for using my site!</h3>
